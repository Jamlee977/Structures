# Data Structures

## ArrayLink<>
It works like a dynamic array but with build-in methods that help programmers

## Stack<>
Imagine it like plates sorted one on another, the last element in it is the first to be printed while the first element is the last to be printed

## Queue<>
The name suggests it, a queue where the first element gets printed/removed first
